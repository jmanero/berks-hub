BerksHub
========
An implementation of the Berkshelf API for indexing cookbooks in GitHub Release
Assets.

## Cookbooks as Release Artifacts
To allow a repository to be indexed as a cookbook, it must have at least one
release with two file artifacts:
 * `metadata.json` The coolbook version's compiled metadata, e.g. generated by
   `knife cookbook metadata from file metadata.rb`
 * `cookbook.tar.gz` The tar-balled cookbook
